ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS, UNCONTROLLED (E11.65)
   - HbA1c increased to 8.6%, above goal of <7.5% for this patient
   - Will add Empagliflozin 10mg daily - has CV and renal protective benefits
   - Continue Metformin 1000mg BID (renal function still allows)
   - Continue Glipizide 10mg BID
   - Dietary counseling provided, referred to diabetes educator
   - Goal HbA1c <7.5%, fasting glucose 80-130 mg/dL
   - Recheck HbA1c in 3 months

2. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, STAGE 3b (N18.4)
   - eGFR declined from 52 to 48, now Stage 3b
   - New onset moderate albuminuria (UACR 180)
   - Started Empagliflozin for renal protection
   - Continue ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril)
   - Referral to nephrology for co-management
   - Avoid NSAIDs, limit protein intake
   - Monitor potassium closely

3. HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL (I10)
   - BP 148/88, not at goal (<130/80 per guidelines)
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg and Amlodipine 10mg
   - Consider adding Chlorthalidone if BP remains elevated
   - Home BP monitoring advised, target <130/80
   - Dietary sodium restriction counseling

4. HYPERLIPIDEMIA (E78.5)
   - LDL 112, above goal of <70 for diabetic patient with CKD
   - Increase Atorvastatin to 80mg at bedtime
   - Continue dietary modifications
   - Recheck lipid panel in 6 weeks

5. PERIPHERAL EDEMA (R60.0)
   - Bilateral LE edema, likely multifactorial (CKD, venous insufficiency, amlodipine)
   - Continue Furosemide 20mg daily
   - Leg elevation, compression stockings recommended
   - Monitor weight daily
   - If worsening, may need cardiology evaluation

6. DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (E11.42)
   - Chronic, stable on current Gabapentin regimen
   - Continue Gabapentin 300mg TID
   - Annual foot exams, proper footwear
   - Patient educated on foot care and daily inspection

7. OBESITY (E66.9)
   - BMI 34.2, contributing to metabolic syndrome
   - Discussed weight loss strategies
   - Empagliflozin may assist with modest weight loss
   - Goal: 5-10% weight reduction over 6-12 months
   - Consider referral to medical weight management if interested

PREVENTIVE CARE:
- Influenza vaccine: Given today
- Pneumococcal vaccine: Up to date
- Colonoscopy: Due (last done 2015) - ordered
- Mammogram: Due - ordered
- Diabetic eye exam: Last 4 months ago, annual follow-up scheduled
- Podiatry referral: Annual diabetic foot exam

FOLLOW-UP:
- Return in 4 weeks to assess response to medication changes
- Labs before next visit: BMP, HbA1c
- Call if symptoms worsen: increased swelling, shortness of breath, chest pain, weight gain >3 lbs in 1 week

Patient verbalized understanding of the treatment plan and all questions were answered.
Time spent: 35 minutes, greater than 50% in counseling and coordination of care.
