DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP:

ECG (14:38): Sinus tachycardia with frequent PVCs, ST elevation V1-V4 (2-3mm), reciprocal ST depression in II, III, aVF. Findings consistent with acute anterior STEMI.

LABORATORY RESULTS:

- PT/INR: 12.1/1.0
- PTT: 28 seconds

Chest X-Ray (portable): Mild cardiomegaly, early pulmonary vascular congestion, no pneumothorax

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:
1. Acute STEMI protocol activated at 14:42
2. Cardiology notified - Dr. Ramirez responded immediately
3. Cath lab activated - door-to-balloon time goal <90 minutes
4. Medications administered:
   - Aspirin 324mg PO (total 486mg including home dose)
   - Ticagrelor 180mg PO loading dose
   - Heparin 5000 unit IV bolus, then infusion
   - Atorvastatin 80mg PO
   - Metoprolol 5mg IV x2 (HR now 88, BP 142/88)
   - Morphine 2mg IV for pain (now 3/10)
   - Ondansetron 4mg IV for nausea
5. Oxygen continued at 4L NC, SpO2 97%
6. Patient consented for cardiac catheterization

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION RESULTS (performed 15:18-15:52):
- Left Main: No significant disease
- LAD: 99% thrombotic occlusion in proximal segment (CULPRIT LESION)
- LCx: 50% stenosis in mid-segment
- RCA: 60% stenosis in proximal segment
- Intervention: Successful PCI to proximal LAD with drug-eluting stent (3.0 x 28mm)
- Post-PCI TIMI 3 flow achieved
- Door-to-balloon time: 68 minutes

POST-PROCEDURE VITAL SIGNS:
- BP: 128/78 mmHg
- HR: 76 bpm, regular sinus rhythm
- SpO2: 98% on 2L NC
- Pain: 0/10

ASSESSMENT:
1. Acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (I21.0) - status post successful PCI with DES to LAD
2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled (E11.65)
3. Essential Hypertension (I10)
4. Hyperlipidemia (E78.5)
5. Obesity (E66.9)
